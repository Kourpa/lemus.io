As a computer scientist at AMRDEC I wear many hats. My day to day consists of leading a development team responsible for creating a .Net Web Application. I utilize JIRA and Agile/Scrum methodologies to efficiently manage the development team, assist in generating reports to communicate status to leadership, and collaborate with other developers as well as performing code reviews and tests. 
Additionally I develop data virtualization and visualization software utilizing Spring, GraphQL, D3, and Hibernate. This software is used as a single consolidated and uniform REST API which gives developers access to all disparate digital simulation data that the Missile Defense Agency produces. 
My additional responsibilities include Research and Development, maintaining and controlling virtual environments using VirtualBox and Linux Containers which host: JIRA, BitBucker, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Datameer, Hadoop, GraphQL, and Sark. Research, design, and development of data science tools not currently being utilized by the federal government. Demonstrate customized tool capabilities to potential customers.
